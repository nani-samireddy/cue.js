## üíª Code Contributions

### Setup Development Environment

1.  **Fork** the Cue.js repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/nani-samireddy/cue.js.git](https://github.com/nani-samireddy/cue.js.git)
    cd cue.js

    git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature-name
    # or
    git checkout -b bugfix/fix-issue-number
    ```

### Making Changes

* Make your changes in the `src/` directory.
* Ensure your code adheres to the existing coding style.
* Run `npm run build` to compile your changes into the `dist/` folder.
* Test your changes thoroughly. You can open `index.html` locally to test (remember to link `dist/cue.umd.js` and `dist/cue.css`).

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

    * Good commit message examples:
        * `feat: Add new 'center' tooltip position`
        * `fix(tooltip): Correct arrow positioning in IE11`
        * `docs: Update usage examples in README`
    * Use conventional commits if possible (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `build:`).
2.  **Push your branch** to your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/my-new-feature-name
    ```
3.  **Open a Pull Request** on the original Cue.js repository.
    * Provide a clear title and description of your changes.
